## Why This Matters:

This is not just a visual or pricing delta‚Äî**Price Perception Difference (PPD)** is a behavioral insight metric.

Understanding the cognitive gap between **what consumers expect to pay** and **what they actually pay** reveals elasticity, dissatisfaction risk, or perceived value alignment.

##  Strategic Interpretation:

> **Perceived value ‚â† promotional dependency.**  
> BOGO promotions can simulate value **without altering unit price**, leveraging time sensitivity and psychological framing.

This behavioral response opens the door for **price framing strategies** that preserve margin while maintaining consumer engagement.

---

## Actionable Takeaways:

- Use **Price Perception Difference (PPD)** to test margin boundaries and brand strength.
- Align **promotion messaging** with expected price anchors (not just shelf price).
- Consider **BOGO and similar ‚Äúsimulated‚Äù discounts** as strategic tools‚Äînot just short-term volume drivers.
