- **Promotion Type:** BOGO

- **Perceived Price per Ounce:** $0.05  
- **Actual Price per Ounce:** $0.05  
- **Price Perception Difference:** 0.00

#### ✅ Key Insight:
Despite the promotional framing (BOGO), Costco’s pricing maintains transparency. The **unit cost matches perception** due to clear dual-pack formatting and clean price labeling. This alignment supports **trust** and **regression integrity** in price-perception modeling.

### Case 2: Sam’s Club — Clearance Deal Distorts Price Perception

- **Promotion Type:** Clearance  
- **Actual Price per Pack:** $2.54 × 2  
- **Total Size:** 49.5oz × 2 = 99oz  
- **Perceived Price per Ounce:** $0.05  
- **Actual Price per Ounce:** $0.18  
- **Price Perception Difference:** +0.13

#### Key Insight:
While the clearance price appears low, it **masks true cost** due to **duplicated packaging structure**. Unlike Costco’s explicit BOGO, the Clearance tag here creates **visual price compression**, misleading consumers into thinking they’re getting a better deal than they are.

### 🧠 Behavioral Reflection
Although both stores offered the **same size and nearly identical price**, the difference in **promotion type** led to dramatically different **perception vs. reality outcomes**:

- **Costco** → Clear BOGO structure = **consumer trust retained**
- **Sam’s Club** → Clearance tag = **perception skew & visual outlier**

This distinction illustrates a broader theme in behavioral economics:  
> “Visual distortions don’t just happen on shelves—they happen in the mind.”

### 🧠 Strategic Takeaways
- **Promotion Clarity Matters:** Retailers must recognize how perceived value is shaped by framing—not just raw price.
- **Outliers Need Context:** Analysts should investigate outlier points instead of default removal—behavioral clues often reside there.
- **Excel Cross-Validation Adds Depth:** Identifying exact transaction dates, Entry_IDs, and batch detail clarified data origins.
- **Tooltip-Level Analysis = Discovery:** Tooltip metrics revealed **hidden pricing behavior** that would be missed in raw visuals alone.
