## 🔍 Key Insight

Despite identical price-per-ounce conditions across multiple **BOGO** and **No Promotion** periods, consumer **price perception** shifted significantly based on the **type of promotion** and the **brand involved**—particularly at **Amazon Fresh**. This signals a deep behavioral layer that exists between shelf pricing and perceived value.

🔹 Multiple pricing spikes occurred in:
- Q1 2021  
- Q2 2022  
- Q2 2023  
- Q1 2025  

Despite **no active promotion**, perceived price rose and purchasing behavior remained strong—highlighting the role of **habitual purchasing**, **trust**, and **necessity-based urgency** in price tolerance.

## 📊 Visual 2: All Brands – No Promotion Trend Comparison (Amazon Fresh)

🔹General Mills maintains a **dominant perceived value** across Amazon Fresh, even without active promotions, when compared with Kellogg’s, Post, and Malt-O-Meal.  
This reinforces the idea that **brand strength + inflation expectations** shape price perception more than discount visibility.

## 📊 Visual 3: 10% OFF – Weak Promotional Signal

🔹Despite a visible 10% OFF promo, perceived price impact remained flat—showing **little to no influence** on how consumers perceived value.  
This points to **low promotional salience** unless the discount is either urgent (BOGO) or deeply framed (Clearance).

---

## 📊 Visual 4: Clearance – Stronger Behavioral Framing

🔹Clearance pricing created a more **noticeable dip in perceived price** for most brands, even when actual price movement was minor.  
This confirms that **language framing** can shift perception *without changing real price*.

---

## 🧠 Behavioral Interpretation

> “Perceived Value ≠ Promotional Dependency”

BOGO and Clearance drive emotional engagement.  
10% OFF feels like background noise.  
No Promotion works *if* consumers believe in the brand or need the product.

Across all views, General Mills maintained strong PPD patterns—suggesting **elasticity through trust** and **habitual urgency**.

---

## Strategic Implications

- Use **Price Perception Difference (PPD)** analysis to spot margin opportunities.
- Avoid over-reliance on minor discounts that don’t shift perception.
- Consider retailer-specific strategies: Amazon Fresh appears highly **anchored by brand equity** and **promotion framing language**.
