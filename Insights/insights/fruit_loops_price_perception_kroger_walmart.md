### 🟪 Walmart: Perception vs. Reality Gap (Scatterplot Analysis)
| Metric                          | Value       |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| Actual Price per Ounce           | $0.44       |
| Perceived Price per Ounce        | $1.12       |
| Price Perception Difference      | **–$0.34**  |
| Retailer                         | Walmart     |
| Brand                            | Kellogg’s (Froot Loops) |

> This data point was flagged in a scatterplot (Price Perception vs. Actual Price), where Froot Loops fell far **below the regression line**, signaling underpricing relative to its perceived value.

**Implication:** Walmart holds hidden pricing power — consumer perception already allows for a **price >2.5x higher** than what’s charged.

## 🟢 Behavioral Takeaway

Not all price gaps are negative. A *consumer-facing underprice* can:
- Signal brand generosity  
- Reinforce customer satisfaction  
- Increase price acceptance for future lifts  

For consumers, buying Froot Loops — especially at a “surprising deal” — may **affirm emotional value, nostalgia, and personal economic strength**, rather than just chasing a bargain.

- **Elasticity Management** – Gradual, perception-informed price increases  
- **Behavioral Anchoring** – Leveraging legacy product familiarity to shield pricing shifts  
- **AI-Forecasting Alignment** – Using perception gaps to refine pricing thresholds
