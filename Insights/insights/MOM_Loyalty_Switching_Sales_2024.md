## Summary

In the final phases of brand loyalty analysis, **Malt-O-Meal (MOM)** unexpectedly emerged as a *Hero Brand* in the budget cereal segment ‚Äî not just holding its ground against private labels like Kroger Brand and Great Value, but **outperforming national brands like Quaker Oats** in total sales and brand loyalty **within the dataset scope.**

Two product standouts ‚Äî **Frosted Flakes** and **Berry Colossal Crunch** ‚Äî revealed how MOM is quietly winning over budget-conscious customers *without heavy promotions or national-level branding spend.*

- **Switch Frequency Score:** **0.39** ‚Äî indicating *strong brand stickiness*
- **Retailer Spotlight (Kroger):** Kroger drove the highest loyalty with MOM Frosted Flakes (16.09%) and the lowest switching score (0.34) of the entire dataset.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ MOM‚Äôs Berry Colossal Crunch (All Retailers, 2020‚Äì2025)
- **Top-Selling MOM Product:** $484,974 (42.15%) in 2021

 **Implication:** Berry Colossal Crunch functions as both a gateway product and loyalty anchor ‚Äî possibly **cannibalizing Cap‚Äôn Crunch Berries (Quaker Oats)** due to identical flavor and packaging perception at a better price-per-ounce.

## üéØ Behavioral Takeaway

> Even when customers ‚Äúswitch‚Äù within the MOM product line, they remain anchored to the brand ‚Äî this isn‚Äôt disloyalty, it‚Äôs **flavor flexibility** within a trusted, budget-friendly portfolio.

This pattern of **intra-brand loyalty** suggests that MOM is **not losing customers**, but rather strengthening retention through flavor variety and value.

##  Strategic Note

This insight supports a broader strategic opportunity for both:
- **Retailers** (e.g., Kroger) seeking high-retention, private-label-alternative products.
- **MOM (Post Consumer Brands)**, which can position Frosted Flakes and Berry Colossal Crunch as *hero products* across regional and national markets.
