- **Actual pricing consistently underperformed** compared to AI-projected pricing, signaling **intentional restraint** in execution.

- **Kroger had the largest overall gap** (~$3.2K), but its **store brand (Kroger Brand)** showed strong alignment, with only a ~$540 gap â€” indicating strategic containment of national brand pricing while optimizing store-brand competitiveness.

- **Walmart and Samâ€™s Club** showed larger retailer-level price gaps (~$2.7K and ~$1.4K), yet **Great Value** and **Memberâ€™s Mark** maintained near-parity with projections.

- **Targetâ€™s Good & Gather** had the **tightest pricing alignment** among private labels â€” a subtle but powerful insight suggesting brand positioning as a premium yet inflation-conscious alternative.

- Overall, **warehouse clubs (Costco, Samâ€™s Club)** demonstrated **tighter price discipline** than traditional retailers, especially at the store-brand level (**Kirkland Signature** had the **smallest price difference** of all brands).

 **Interpretation:** Retailers may be leveraging behavioral economics by keeping national brand prices below projection to nudge consumers toward high-margin store brands.
