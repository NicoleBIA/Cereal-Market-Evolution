#  Cereal Market Evolution | Project Strategy & WHY Document  
 *Why I Designed This Project the Way I Did*

---

## ðŸŸ¦ Purpose  
This project was built with intentionalityâ€”not just to showcase data visualization, but to simulate a **real-world consulting engagement**. I designed it from the perspective of a Market Intelligence & Strategy Analyst leading an insight project for CPG and Retail stakeholders. Every dataset, visual, and narrative is grounded in business logic, psychological framing, and strategic foresight.

---

## ðŸŸª What Informed My Thinking  
Rather than simply displaying data, I envisioned the project as an opportunity to:  
- Reflect how **human behavior, business strategy, and data** intersect  
- Translate **multidimensional insights** into actionable business intelligence  
- Design an environment that mirrors **stakeholder-focused consulting**

This project sits at the intersection of:  
- **Behavioral Psychology** (consumer patterns, decision behavior)  
- **Business Intelligence** (data modeling, KPI design, visual storytelling)  
- **Process Optimization** (root cause analysis, promo performance)  
- **AI-Augmented Insight Development** (ChatGPT collaboration)
