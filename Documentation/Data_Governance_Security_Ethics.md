## Purpose

This document outlines the **data governance, security protocols, and ethical considerations** guiding the design and execution of the *Cereal Market Evolution* market intelligence project. While this is a simulated study using synthetic data, the structure reflects real-world principles of responsible data analysis for strategic pricing and consumer insights.

##  Overview

| Category        | Scope Summary |
|----------------|----------------|
| **Data Type**  | AI-generated, fully synthetic dataset (no PII or real transactions) |
| **Tooling**    | Power BI, Excel, GitHub |
| **Focus Areas**| Retailer pricing, consumer behavior, AI price modeling |

## 🗂️ 1. Data Governance

> Clear structure, version control, and auditability across all project layers.

- **Data Provenance:**  
  All datasets were created synthetically to mirror real-world conditions — no live customer, retailer, or sales systems were used.

- **Relational Data Modeling:**  
  A structured **star-schema** model with dimension and fact tables was established in Power BI, with a dedicated `Retailer_Batch_Key` column serving as a primary relationship key.

- **Documentation & Metadata:**  
  A data dictionary, model screenshot, and DAX measure inventory are included in the GitHub `/PowerBI/` folder for transparency and reusability.

- **Version Control & Change History:**  
  GitHub is used to document changes to visualizations, insights, and calculations — enabling collaborative traceability.

## 🔒 2. Data Security

> Simulated scope with secure, structured practices reflecting enterprise-ready thinking.

- **No Sensitive Data:**  
  The project contains no personally identifiable information (PII), consumer accounts, or sensitive retailer contracts.

- **File Segmentation:**  
  Visuals, source files, and markdown documentation are stored in clean, well-organized directories to mimic production-grade repository hygiene.

- **Role-based Access (hypothetical Power BI deployment):**  
  In a real-world setting, **Row-Level Security (RLS)** and **workspace permission controls** would be enforced for retailer-specific dashboards.

## ⚖️ 3. Data Ethics

> Transparency, fairness, and responsible use of data storytelling.

- **Synthetic AI Forecast Disclaimer:**  
  AI-projected pricing was generated for simulation and learning purposes. No claims are made regarding real-world pricing behavior or predictive accuracy.

- **Bias & Consumer Impact Transparency:**  
  The project examines phenomena such as **anchoring bias**, **shrinkflation**, and **price-per-ounce distortion** — illuminating real behavioral economics mechanisms that affect consumers.

- **Brand & Retailer Fairness:**  
  All national and store brands were treated equitably, with naming conventions and price logic grounded in retail realism. No favoritism or manipulation of results was applied.

- **Ethical Storytelling:**  
  All visuals are scaled and annotated truthfully — no truncated axes or misleading comparisons are used.

This file serves to reinforce the project's **strategic integrity, AI transparency, and stakeholder trustworthiness.** Future clients, employers, or collaborators can reference this document as a model for integrating governance, security, and ethics into consumer and market-facing analytics work.
