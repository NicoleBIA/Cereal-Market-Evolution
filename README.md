##  **Project Overview**
The **Cereal Market Evolution** project is a **Business Intelligence & AI-Driven Market Strategy** initiative that analyzes **cereal pricing, inflation trends, consumer behavior, and brand-switching insights from 2020 to present**. This study helps retailers and Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) companies understand:

- **Pricing Volatility:** How retailers adjust prices in response to inflation and competition.
- **Private Labels vs. National Brands:** How inflation impacts consumer brand loyalty.
- **AI-Driven Forecasting:** Predicting future pricing trends based on economic indicators.
- **Shrinkflation & Retailer Strategies:** Identifying product downsizing trends and SKU adjustments.

## 🔐 <a name="data-governance-security--ethics"></a>Data Governance, Security & Ethics

> 📁 **File:** `/PowerBI/Data_Governance_Security_Ethics.md`

This section outlines the project’s simulated context, governance protocols, and ethical standards, including:
- Transparency about synthetic data use  
- Responsible visualization to avoid misrepresentation  
- Professional handling of proprietary or business-critical information  
- Alignment with real-world stakeholder expectations for confidentiality & trust  


## 📊 **Key Business Questions & Analysis Goals**
This project investigates the following **critical business intelligence questions**:
- How have **cereal prices changed over time** across different retailers?
- Which retailers show the most **price volatility and stability**?
- How do **private label/store brands compare** to national brands in pricing trends?
- Do consumers **switch to private labels** during inflation spikes?
- How do **warehouse clubs (Costco & Sam’s Club)** compare to standard grocery retailers in price stability?
- How does real-world **cereal pricing compare to CPI inflation trends**?

## 📂 **Data Sources & Structure**
The analysis integrates multiple datasets, each contributing to the broader pricing and consumer behavior trends.

### **Primary Dataset: Cereal Sales & Pricing**
- **Retailer & Brand Data:** National brands (Kellogg’s, General Mills, Post, etc.) & Private labels (Walmart's Great Value, Kroger Brand, etc.).
- **Pricing Trends:** Historical price changes from **January 2020 – February 2025**.
- **Product Sizes & Shrinkflation Adjustments:** Packaging changes across time.
- **Promotions & Discounts:** Tracking deals such as **BOGO, % off, and clearance pricing**.
- **Sales Volume Data:** Simulated purchase behaviors across retailers.
- **Region-Specific Analysis:** Midwest/South, National, South/Midwest, West National.

### **Supplementary Datasets**

1️⃣ **Loyalty & Brand Switching Data** → Captures consumer **repeat purchases vs. switching behavior**.

2️⃣ **Perceived Price vs. Actual Price Data** → Analyzes **price anchoring bias & perception gaps**.

3️⃣ **Price Sensitivity Score Data** → Measures **pricing elasticity per retailer & brand**.

4️⃣ **AI-Driven Price Projection Data** → Forecasts future price trends **using CPI & historical data**.

5️⃣ **CPI Inflation Data (QoQ & YoY)** → Used for **macroeconomic comparison**.

## 🔗 **Power BI Data Model & Relationships**
The project leverages **Power BI** for advanced analytics and interactive visualizations. The datasets are linked using **`Retailer_Batch_Key`**, which acts as the **primary relational key** across tables.

### **Relationships Established**
- **Cereal Sales Dataset** (Primary) ↔ **Loyalty & Brand Switching** (One-to-Many)
- **Cereal Sales Dataset** (Primary) ↔ **Perceived Price vs. Actual Price** (One-to-Many)
- **Cereal Sales Dataset** (Primary) ↔ **Price Sensitivity Score Data** (One-to-Many)
- **Cereal Sales Dataset** (Primary) ↔ **AI-Driven Price Projections** (One-to-Many)
- **Cereal Sales Dataset** (Primary) ↔ **CPI Inflation Data** (One-to-One, Quarter-Based)

## 📈 **Key Insights & Preliminary Findings**
### **1️⃣ Retailer Pricing Strategies & Product Exclusivity**
- Warehouse clubs (Costco & Sam’s Club) **offer better price stability** but with fewer cereal SKUs.
- Traditional grocery retailers show **higher price fluctuations** based on promotions & demand.
- Private label brands are **more resilient during inflation spikes**, with Walmart & Kroger seeing a rise in store-brand sales.

### **2️⃣ Shrinkflation & Product Downsizing**
- Example: **Kellogg’s Frosted Mini Wheats** reduced from **24 oz to 20 oz** while keeping the **“Family Size”** label.
- Consumers are often **unaware** of these changes unless tracked at the unit price ($/oz) level.
- Some retailers still have **older inventory**, leading to mixed product sizes in the market.

### **3️⃣ AI-Driven Price Forecasting**
- Inflation-adjusted predictions indicate **cereal prices will continue rising** but at a **slower pace**.
- High-price elasticity brands (e.g., **Kashi, Quaker**) are expected to see **lower demand shifts**.
