## 🟪 Project Theme and Scope

**Harvest View CPG** and the **Retail Intelligence Alliance (RIA)** partnered in a simulated industry engagement to analyze consumer behavior, pricing psychology, and promotional effectiveness across the U.S. cold cereal market (2020–2025). This report delivers strategic intelligence to:

- **Harvest View**: Improve brand pricing strategies, shrinkflation communication, and consumer retention
- **RIA**: Strengthen retailer pricing, margin forecasting, and perception vs. reality strategy

---

## 🟦 Executive Summary

This analysis explores cereal sales performance between 2020–2025, uncovering how inflation, price sensitivity, and shifting consumer loyalty have impacted brand performance and retailer dynamics.

Key insights include:

- A **13% decline in brand loyalty** during peak inflation periods (2022–2023)
- A **projected 8% drop in unit sales** tied to AI-forecasted price increases
- And, based on segmentation analysis, **“No Promotion” sales outperformed both 10% Off/Clearance by 11% and BOGO offers by 6%** in total revenue contribution

These patterns highlight the nuanced relationship between consumer psychology, perceived value, and discount strategy. Leveraging behavioral economics, Power BI Key Influencers, and custom loyalty metrics, this report offers actionable recommendations for optimizing pricing strategies and sustaining market share in a volatile economic climate.

**Methodology Note:**
> All data transformations, metrics, and visualizations were developed manually through DAX modeling, iterative design, and structured exploratory analysis. The only AI-assisted element Power BI’s Key Influencers visual—was selectively used to validate observed patterns. It served as a complementary tool, not a driver of insight. This report reflects end-to-end analytical ownership, strategic interpretation, and a deep commitment to methodological transparency and integrity.

## 🟡 Business Problem

As inflation accelerates and shrinkflation reduces perceived value, brands and retailers face three major risks:

- **Losing price trust** with consumers through silent price hikes
- **Eroding margin** through overly generous or poorly timed promotions
- **Misjudging loyalty** by treating brand-switching as disloyalty instead of price sensitivity

---

## 🟩 Business Questions

- Which brands maintained loyalty despite pricing shifts?
- How do promotions (e.g., BOGO, 10% Off, Clearance) affect sales behavior?
- Where does consumer perception diverge from actual price?
- Which retailers exhibit the highest price volatility or margin risk?
- What trade-offs exist between price, volume, and perceived value?
