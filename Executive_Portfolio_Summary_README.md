## 🟪 Project Theme and Scope

**Harvest View CPG** and the **Retail Intelligence Alliance (RIA)** partnered in a simulated industry engagement to analyze consumer behavior, pricing psychology, and promotional effectiveness across the U.S. cold cereal market (2020–2025). This report delivers strategic intelligence to:

- **Harvest View**: Improve brand pricing strategies, shrinkflation communication, and consumer retention
- **RIA**: Strengthen retailer pricing, margin forecasting, and perception vs. reality strategy

---

## 🟦 Executive Summary

Through advanced behavioral modeling, Power BI dashboards, and relational dataset construction, this project offers actionable insight into how price perception, promotional structure, and loyalty shape profitability and market positioning in the cereal industry.

This cross-functional analysis blends CPI inflation benchmarks, pricing elasticity, retailer strategy, and consumer psychology to simulate and forecast the impact of subtle changes in price structure, packaging, and promotional visibility.

---

## 🟩 What Stakeholders Gain

- **Executives**: CPG and Retailer-level pricing recommendations backed by loyalty and inflation models  
- **BI Leaders**: Behavioral economic insight applied to price perception and SKU-level loyalty  
- **Hiring Managers**: Strategic reasoning, segmentation design, and actionable forecasting embedded in reporting

---

## 🟪 Introduction

This report presents a simulated, full-scale BI engagement that transforms complex cereal market behavior into a rich decision-support framework. Designed in Power BI, it includes over **21 visual narratives**, interactive slicers, and DAX-powered metrics.

## 🟡 Business Problem

As inflation accelerates and shrinkflation reduces perceived value, brands and retailers face three major risks:

- **Losing price trust** with consumers through silent price hikes
- **Eroding margin** through overly generous or poorly timed promotions
- **Misjudging loyalty** by treating brand-switching as disloyalty instead of price sensitivity

---

## 🟩 Business Questions

- Which brands maintained loyalty despite pricing shifts?
- How do promotions (e.g., BOGO, 10% Off, Clearance) affect sales behavior?
- Where does consumer perception diverge from actual price?
- Which retailers exhibit the highest price volatility or margin risk?
- What trade-offs exist between price, volume, and perceived value?
