# 🧠 Strategic Recommendation: Price Per Ounce, Shrinkflation & Value Perception

---

### 📌 Business Question:
**How does unit pricing influence perceived value, retailer strategy, and consumer loyalty during inflationary cycles?**  
Can retailers leverage per-ounce insights to better position brands amid shrinkflation?

---

### 🧾 Executive Summary:
Unit pricing has emerged as one of the most revealing indicators of real consumer cost amid inflation. While shelf prices often appear low, the **price per ounce quietly escalates**, especially for nostalgic or high-trust products. Consumers respond to **anchoring bias** — perceiving a $2.79 cereal as affordable — while unknowingly paying **$0.42/oz or more**.

This recommendation highlights how **price perception ≠ price reality** — and offers retailers and CPG brands an opportunity to recalibrate messaging, packaging, and promotion strategy.

## ✅ Strategic Recommendations:

1. **Communicate Value Per Ounce, Not Just Shelf Price:**  
   Educate consumers via digital shelf tags or packaging cues — especially during inflation cycles.

2. **Audit Legacy Brand Pricing for Margin Optimization:**  
   Products like Froot Loops can withstand pricing power due to nostalgia and trust — identify similar SKUs.

3. **Bundle Promotions by Unit Value:**  
   Reinforce deals around $/oz or value packs rather than sticker discounts to preserve perceived savings.

4. **Differentiate Private Label Strategy by Format:**  
   Warehouse clubs can lean into bulk efficiency. Traditional grocers should consider **repackaging or reformatting** to avoid being undercut by club players.
