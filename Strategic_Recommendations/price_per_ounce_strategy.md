# Strategic Recommendation: Unit Pricing, Value Perception & Froot Loops Loyalty

---

### Business Question:
How do average price per ounce trends influence consumer value perception, and what pricing signals are retailers and brands sending ‚Äî intentionally or not?

---

# Executive Summary:
Across brands and retailers, pricing strategies often exploit cognitive shortcuts like **anchoring bias**, where shelf price creates the illusion of affordability ‚Äî while **unit price quietly escalates**. This is especially evident with nostalgic products like Froot Loops, where price hikes are tolerated due to brand trust. Retailers like Kroger use private labels and legacy SKUs to **quietly raise margins without disrupting buyer behavior**.

Private label brands often disguise higher unit prices behind low total shelf costs. Quaker Oats‚Äô $0.29/oz (despite shelf price of ~$2.79) may signal **shrinkflation**, while store brands like **Kroger** lead at **$0.42/oz**. Club brands (e.g., Member's Mark, Kirkland) drive **maximum value perception**, some as low as **$0.17/oz**.

   Emphasize value per ounce in marketing messaging to challenge legacy brands.

3. **Leverage Legacy SKUs Like Froot Loops**  
   Anchor pricing increases to products with high emotional loyalty ‚Äî but **don‚Äôt overdo it**, or you risk backlash.

4. **Audit for Shrinkflation Signals**  
   Track brands like Quaker and Kellogg‚Äôs where low shelf prices hide higher $/oz creep, and design mitigation strategies.
