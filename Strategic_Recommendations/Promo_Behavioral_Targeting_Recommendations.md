# Strategic Recommendation  
## Promotion-Based Behavioral Targeting & BOGO Trigger Optimization

---

## 🧩 Business Question:
How can retailers and consumer packaged goods (CPG) brands use **behavioral patterns in promotion response** to optimize pricing strategies and trigger promotions more effectively?

---

## Purpose of the Analysis:
To uncover when and how consumers respond to different types of promotions (No Promotion, BOGO, 10% Off, Clearance) and determine what retailer performance thresholds correlate with **triggering specific promo types** — particularly **BOGO offers**.

---

## Executive Summary:
The analysis of **Q1 2023 sales performance** and **probability lift modeling** revealed that:

- **No Promotion** periods outperformed 10% Off discounts in revenue across multiple brands.
- **BOGO promotions** become **2% more likely** to be triggered when retailer sales surpass **$953.13** — signaling a behavioral threshold that aligns with real-world sales conditions.
- **10% Off** promotions showed **limited behavioral impact** — often underperforming against both BOGO and No Promo scenarios.

> Retailer and consumer behavior reflect **strategic intent**, not random discounting.

## 💼 Strategic Recommendations

1. **Reframe “No Promotion” as a Value Signal**  
   Consumers are responding to familiar, necessity-driven brands even without discounting — lean into that with value-based messaging and positioning.

2. **Use BOGO Strategically, Not Universally**  
   Trigger BOGO only when volume efficiency, retailer readiness, and brand loyalty align — especially as sales exceed $950–$1000+ per cycle.

3. **Reevaluate “10% Off” as Default Discounting Strategy**  
   If consumers perceive small discounts as negligible, they may delay purchases or ignore promos altogether. Replace with more behaviorally effective triggers or time-sensitive scarcity plays.

4. **Incorporate Probability Lift Models into Pricing Reviews**  
   Integrate influencer visualizations and segmentation modeling into pricing dashboards to uncover invisible behavioral signals.
