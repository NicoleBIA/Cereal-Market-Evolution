# Strategic Recommendation: Price Per Ounce, Value Perception & Froot Loops Margin Strategy

---

## Business Question
How do shelf prices, unit prices, and behavioral pricing biases impact consumer value perception across brands and retailers — and what opportunities exist to optimize margins or reposition products accordingly?

---

# Executive Summary
Analysis of average price per ounce ($/oz) data across brands and retailers revealed key disconnects between **perceived affordability** and **true consumer cost**. Store brands like Kroger, Great Value, and Good & Gather outpriced national brands on a per-ounce basis by 2024–2025, despite appearing cheaper on the shelf. 

Further, Power BI flagged **Kellogg’s Froot Loops at Kroger** as the most influential SKU affecting price distribution — driven by a **+31.9% $/oz increase** between 2021 and 2025. These findings suggest that **retailers and CPGs are strategically leveraging familiarity and brand trust** to raise unit margins without triggering price sensitivity.

## Strategic Insight 1: Shelf Price ≠ Real Cost
While consumers anchor decisions on visible shelf prices, the **true cost per ounce is often significantly higher** — especially for store brands.

**Insight**: Kroger's store brand led national and private label brands at $0.42/oz.

✅ **Action**:
- Introduce transparent unit pricing tags or mobile scanning tools.
- Use $/oz benchmarks when setting new pack sizes or price tiers.

## Strategic Insight 2: Psychology Drives Overpayment
Anchoring bias drives trust in store brands — creating a **perception of affordability** that masks **hidden cost increases via shrinkflation**.

**Insight**: By 2025, major store brands reached $0.41–$0.48/oz — higher than several national brands.

✅ **Action**:
- Perform behavioral audits on pricing strategies across retailers.
- Reframe promotions to highlight real per-ounce savings (e.g., bulk SKUs).

## Strategic Insight 3: Froot Loops Margin Optimization
**Froot Loops (Kellogg’s)** sold through Kroger showed a **+31.9% per-ounce price increase (2021–2025)** — peaking at **$0.62/oz in Q1 2025**.

**Insight**: Power BI identified this SKU as the **top contributor to $/oz distribution shifts**.

✅ **Action**:
- Identify legacy, high-trust SKUs to replicate this pricing strategy.
- Track price sensitivity scores for high-loyalty products before major pricing shifts.
- Consider bundling or limited-edition SKUs to boost perceived value at higher $/oz.

## Strategic Takeaway
Consumers make fast decisions based on what they *see* — not what they *pay*. In a competitive, inflation-sensitive grocery landscape, **price per ounce reveals the true battleground for trust, loyalty, and margin protection**.
