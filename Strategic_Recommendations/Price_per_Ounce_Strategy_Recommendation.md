---

## ❓ Business Question
How do shelf prices, unit prices, and behavioral pricing biases impact consumer value perception across brands and retailers — and what opportunities exist to optimize margins or reposition products accordingly?

---

## 🧾 Executive Summary
Analysis of average price per ounce ($/oz) data across brands and retailers revealed key disconnects between **perceived affordability** and **true consumer cost**. Store brands like Kroger, Great Value, and Good & Gather outpriced national brands on a per-ounce basis by 2024–2025, despite appearing cheaper on the shelf. 

Further, Power BI flagged **Kellogg’s Froot Loops at Kroger** as the most influential SKU affecting price distribution — driven by a **+31.9% $/oz increase** between 2021 and 2025. These findings suggest that **retailers and CPGs are strategically leveraging familiarity and brand trust** to raise unit margins without triggering price sensitivity.

## 🔍 Strategic Insight 1: Shelf Price ≠ Real Cost
While consumers anchor decisions on visible shelf prices, the **true cost per ounce is often significantly higher** — especially for store brands.

✅ **Action**:
- Introduce transparent unit pricing tags or mobile scanning tools.
- Use $/oz benchmarks when setting new pack sizes or price tiers.

## 🔍 Strategic Insight 2: Psychology Drives Overpayment
Anchoring bias drives trust in store brands — creating a **perception of affordability** that masks **hidden cost increases via shrinkflation**.

📌 **Insight**: By 2025, major store brands reached $0.41–$0.48/oz — higher than several national brands.

✅ **Action**:
- Perform behavioral audits on pricing strategies across retailers.
