### 🧠 Psychology of Price vs. Value

- Shoppers may be **ignoring light discounts** entirely, especially under inflationary stress.

---

### 🧪 AI-Driven Price Analysis

- Private labels like **Good & Gather** and **Member’s Mark** showed near-perfect alignment to AI projections.
- This indicates **strategic price signaling**—using restraint to drive store-brand preference.

---

### 📉 Price Volatility & Behavioral Pricing
- Power BI Key Influencers revealed:  
  📉 *As sales fall, $/oz tends to rise*—a **counterintuitive inflation hedge**.
- **Walmart** had the highest price volatility, but **Costco** had some of the **highest $/oz pricing** despite price stability.
- Insight: **Price "calmness" ≠ affordability**.

---

### ❤️ Loyalty & Brand Switching
- **Malt-O-Meal** achieved a **16.09% repeat purchase rate** at Kroger in 2024—7% higher than the national average.
- Consumers rotated within the MOM brand, but **rarely left it**—a strong signal of **intra-brand loyalty**.
- **Quaker**, though still nostalgic, faces pressure from lower-priced competitors.

---

### 🪞 Perceived Price vs. Actual Price
- **BOGO and Clearance promotions** distorted perception, particularly at **Costco and Sam’s Club**.
- Example: A 99oz Cinnamon Toast Crunch clearance deal appeared to be $0.05/oz—but was actually $0.18/oz.
- Strategic implication: **Promotion framing often outweighs price in shaping consumer judgment**.

---

## 📦 Strategic Recommendations
- **Legacy brands** must reframe value with stronger packaging, trust cues, and loyalty programming.
- **Retailers** should amplify “No Promo” value messaging and rethink weak discounting formats.
- Use **perception gaps** and **AI projections** as margin-enhancing levers in consumer communication.
