#### 🟪 BOGO Promotions: Behavioral Triggers and Volume Thresholds  
Power BI’s **Key Influencers and Segmenter visual** revealed a data-driven relationship between sales volume and BOGO promotion likelihood:

- 🔵 **Trigger Threshold:**  
  When **Retailer Sales exceed $953.13**, the likelihood of a BOGO promotion increases by **2%** (*Lift = 1.02x*).

- 🟢 **High-Probability Segment:**  
  Segment 1 showed a **26.3% likelihood of BOGO** usage when **Total Sales ranged between $1,559.16 and $1,852.96**.

- 🟡 **Average BOGO Activation Point:**  
  Across the dataset, BOGO was most frequently triggered around **$1,619.56 in retailer sales**.

> **Strategic Implication:**  
> BOGO promotions are not random—they’re deployed predictively at a **sweet spot of sales performance**, balancing momentum and margin management. Retailers can use these thresholds to simulate promotional timing and effectiveness.

### 🟩 AI-Driven Price Analysis
- AI models projected higher price ceilings than retailers implemented—suggesting **intentional restraint**.
- Private labels like **Good & Gather** and **Member’s Mark** showed near-perfect alignment to AI projections.
- This indicates **strategic price signaling**—using restraint to drive store-brand preference.

---

### 🔵 Price Volatility & Behavioral Pricing
- Power BI Key Influencers revealed:  
> *As sales fall, $/oz tends to rise*—a **counterintuitive inflation hedge**.
- **Walmart** had the highest price volatility, but **Costco** had some of the **highest $/oz pricing** despite price stability.
- Insight: **Price "calmness" ≠ affordability**.

---

###  Loyalty & Brand Switching
- **Malt-O-Meal** achieved a **16.09% repeat purchase rate** at Kroger in 2024—7% higher than the national average.
- Consumers rotated within the MOM brand, but **rarely left it**—a strong signal of **intra-brand loyalty**.
- **Quaker**, though still nostalgic, faces pressure from lower-priced competitors.

---

###  Perceived Price vs. Actual Price
- **BOGO and Clearance promotions** distorted perception, particularly at **Costco and Sam’s Club**.
- Example: A 99oz Cinnamon Toast Crunch clearance deal appeared to be $0.05/oz—but was actually $0.18/oz.
- Strategic implication: **Promotion framing often outweighs price in shaping consumer judgment**.

---

## 🟪 Strategic Recommendations
- **Legacy brands** must reframe value with stronger packaging, trust cues, and loyalty programming.
- **Retailers** should amplify “No Promo” value messaging and rethink weak discounting formats.
- Use **perception gaps** and **AI projections** as margin-enhancing levers in consumer communication.
